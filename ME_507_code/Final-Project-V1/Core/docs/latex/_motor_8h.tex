This contains the class and attribute definitions for the \doxylink{class_motor}{Motor} class. It also includes function prototypes for the methods in the class. The motor driver includes 3 main methods along with some setter and getter methods these methods allow for the setting of a duty cycle, the implementation of a classic PID loop, and the implementation of a modified PID loop which starts the integral gain late to prevent overshoot
