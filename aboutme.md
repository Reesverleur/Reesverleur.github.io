title: About me
---

My name is Rees Verleur, I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Cal Poly SLO with a concentration in mechatronics and an interest in fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. I will be attending a Ph.D. program starting next fall at Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN, where I will be focusing on optical diagnostics for complicated fluid flows and building machine-learning tools to interpret the results of these diagnostics.
