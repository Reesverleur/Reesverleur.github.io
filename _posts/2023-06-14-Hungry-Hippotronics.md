This project aimed to create a robot that could autonomously collect & sort balls in a competition. This was the final project for Cal Poly SLO's Mechanical Control System Design course. Students learned to use Fusion 360 to design a circuit board and program in C and C++ on integrated hardware in order to create the final project.
