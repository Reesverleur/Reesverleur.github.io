This project aimed to create a robot that could autonomously collect & sort balls in a competition. This was the final project for Cal Poly SLO's Mechanical Control System Design course. Students learned to use Fusion 360 to design a circuit board and program in C and C++ on integrated hardware in order to create the final project. 

The project began by learning how to use Fusion 360 to create an electrical design. I had never done this before, but I was eager to learn. These skills were first used in a homework assignment to design an 8-bit dip-switch "DAC." It was challenging to get used to new CAD software and consider the intricacies of a new type of design, but in the end, I was able to create the circuit you can see below.

This circuit is very simple, and my routing is not at all optimal, but as my first try using electrical CAD software, I am happy with the results.

Next, we moved on to creating custom parts by making a minimum functional module for the microcontroller we planned to use, an STM32F411. The minimum functional module provided a good stepping off point for the creation of our final design. The feedback I got from the instructor on this design largely informed my final design for the class. This schematic is shown below.

Finally, the time came to design the final board. Using what I had learned so far in the course, along with the instructor feedback on the first revision of my circuit, I created my final design. This design included connectors to attach my motors and sensors and set my pin allocation for the final project. This design can be seen below.
